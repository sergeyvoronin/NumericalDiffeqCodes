These programs solve test problems I and II by using the multigrid algorithm 
with a V-cycle.

1) mg_solver.cpp -> implements 2-D multigrid

compile with: g++ mg_solver.cpp -o mgs -Os
run with: ./mgs
Output data will be in data/ subdirectory.
Next, the matlab script make_plots.m can be used to make plots.

There is a parameter problem_num within both programs which is used to 
specify which test_problem to solve (and plot diagnostics for).
